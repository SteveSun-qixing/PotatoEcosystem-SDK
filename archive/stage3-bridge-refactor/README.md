# Stage3 Bridge Refactor Archive

This directory preserves legacy connector artifacts that were replaced by the Bridge client architecture in stage 3.

Archived files:

- `src-core-connector.ts`: legacy direct connector implementation
- `tests-unit-core-connector.test.archived.ts`: legacy connector unit tests

Reason: keep historical implementation details without leaving dead code on active runtime paths.
